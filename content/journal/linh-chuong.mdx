      Very professional and enthusiastic wedding planners who love their job.
      They helped us with everything while we were abroad, then took care of us
      and our wedding before and after the wedding when we arrived in VN. We
      became friends at the end. Our wedding turned out perfect and it was all
      thanks to Meraki and their team. Highly recommend.
