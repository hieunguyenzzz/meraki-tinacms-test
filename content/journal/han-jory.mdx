      We were so grateful we got to be the stress-free couple throughout the
      whole process, knowing they had everything handled to the tiniest details.

      Even though we later learned that there were some hiccups behind the
      scenes, we had absolutely no idea at the time. Everything felt seamless
      from start to finish. Our guests were having such a great time, and we got
      so many compliments about how beautiful and fun everything was.

      For Hân and Jory, the Lễ Vu Quy was far more than a ceremonial tradition.
      It became a bridge, gently drawing the past and the present into one
      shared moment. Through this celebration, we were invited to rediscover the
      beauty of what once was, as the family home that had witnessed Hân’s
      parents’ wedding thirty-five years ago was once again dressed in vibrant
      color. A familiar space, now alive with joy, welcoming Hân and Jory as
      they began their life as husband and wife.

      Với Hân & Jory, Lễ Vu Quy không chỉ là một nghi thức, mà còn là chiếc cầu
      đưa quá khứ và hiện tại về chung một điểm. Tụi mình được dịp tìm về những
      nét đẹp xưa, để căn nhà từng ghi dấu ngày vui của ba mẹ Hân 35 năm trước
      nay khoác lên mình sắc màu rực rỡ, hân hoan chào đón Hân & Jory chính thức
      nên duyên vợ chồng.

      Hân’s home rests quietly within a narrow alley, its modest and timeworn
      character preserved since the day her grandmother built it. The idea of
      recreating a traditional Lễ Vu Quy emerged as we listened to stories from
      Hân’s mother, Mai, recalling her own wedding day. Those memories became
      the emotional foundation of the celebration.

      Ngôi nhà của Hân nằm nép trong một con hẻm nhỏ vẫn vẹn nguyên nét mộc mạc
      và xưa cũ kể từ ngày Ngoại xây dựng. Ý tưởng tái hiện một Lễ Vu Quy xưa
      được bật lên khi Meraki nghe cô Mai, mẹ của Hân chia sẻ về đám cưới của
      cô.
