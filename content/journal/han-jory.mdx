      We were so grateful we got to be the stress-free couple throughout the
      whole process, knowing they had everything handled to the tiniest details.

      Even though we later learned that there were some hiccups behind the
      scenes, we had absolutely no idea at the time. Everything felt seamless
      from start to finish. Our guests were having such a great time, and we got
      so many compliments about how beautiful and fun everything was.
